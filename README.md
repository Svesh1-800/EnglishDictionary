## **What is the use of an English-English dictionary for studying?**



Obviously, the English-English dictionary is not suitable for everyone. If a person has just started learning a language, then such a dictionary is a bad idea. The explanatory dictionary will not suit students with Beginner and Elementary levels â€” it will be difficult and inconvenient.. Everyone else is recommended to use an English-English dictionary for faster language learning because:

- Learn the meaning of the word, not the translation
- You are learning additional words
- You get more complete information about the studied word
- You are learning to think in English, not translate and etc
